description: Lab 3 experience + pictures of my dog

Lab 3 was a little bit more difficult than the previous lab. I struggled a bit with editing the css and including photos. 
I'm still not completely sure how to edit the css the way I want to. For example, I couldn't figure out how to change
the color of the entire background. I ended up just changing the theme to "dark," which made the background dark grey. But I
would have liked to be able to choose the color I wanted. I'm looking forward to learning new ways to stylize the blog. Also,
I don't know why there is an option at the top to visit "HEAD" on the hosted browser version of my website, but not on the local
version.

Here is the link for [this assignment](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html). And a link to the page I
made for [my dog](https://kbgrizb.github.io/blog/dog/), in case you missed it.

Here's some more pictures of my dog:
